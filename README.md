# Sudoku-Solver

This is a simple and easy to use sudoku solver. It uses tkinter for the gui and a simple backtracking algorithm to solve the board. It isn't the most elegant implementation, but it gets the job done.

This program does require the tkinter module to work.
You can install it with: "pip install tkinter"
